First create the appropriate main.spec file

Command to transform the Python app into a Windows executable (.exe): pyinstaller main.spec

The output will be put in the dist folder (it will ask me to remove all the previous content inside the folder)

Copy all images used in my app from the repo into dist/main (e.g. logo.png)

Finally, use inno setup compiler to create an installation wizard

If I use the inno setup compiler once and create the installation wizard, the script that will be run to create the wizard (called prt-setup-script.iss)
will be created. I can save it and then use the same script to create a new installation wizard if I create new versions of my app
